                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm Aimee Skillin, a Colorado State Commissioned Notary Public, Loan Signing Agent, and Certified Apostille Agent based in Lone Tree, CO. Since launching my notary business in 2023, I've completed over 1,000 mobile notarizations and more than 250 remote online notarization sessions, helping individuals, families, and businesses get their important documents handled with precision and care.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a native speaker of both English and Spanish, and I proudly serve clients in both languages across Colorado. Whether you need a real estate closing walked through in Spanish, a power of attorney notarized at your kitchen table, or an apostille processed for use overseas, I make the experience simple, stress-free, and professional from start to finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm trained by the National Notary Association (NNA) and Loan Signing System (LSS), and I bring that same level of attention and expertise to every single appointment. When you work with me, you're not getting a faceless service. You're getting a real person who genuinely cares about getting things right.
                    </p>
